# You probably don't want this script
Crude script to find duplicate image files in a given directory
and all its subdirectories.  

Creates a "database" - i.e. yaml file - enabling disposal at a later
time.  May choose to dispose of files immediately after finding them 
via cli option. 

"Dispose" means a human decides what to do with duplicates.  
Currently delete is the only option.  The human has the option to 
view the files before deciding.
